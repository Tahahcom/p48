    Roald Dahl[a] (13 September 1916 â€“ 23 November 1990) was a British[1] novelist, short-story writer, poet, screenwriter, and wartime fighter pilot of Norwegian descent.[2] His books have sold more than 250 million copies worldwide.[3] He has been referred to as "one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century".[4]

Dahl was born in Wales to affluent Norwegian immigrant parents, and spent most of his life in England. He served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He became a fighter pilot and, subsequently, an intelligence officer, rising to the rank of acting wing commander. He rose to prominence as a writer in the 1940s with works for children and for adults, and he became one of the world's best-selling authors.[5][6] His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement and the British Book Awards' Children's Author of the Year in 1990. Dahl and his work have been criticised for antisemitism, racial stereotypes and misogyny. In 2008, The Times placed Dahl 16th on its list of "The 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945.
